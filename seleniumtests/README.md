# SeleniumTests

This is a sample test project based on STF (SeleniumTestsFramework).
To know more about STF please refer 
STF [How-To guide](http://www.seleniumtests.com/2013/10/announcing-selenium-tests-automation.html)

This test suite also include tests for android mobile site, android app and ios test as well, hence you must set up Appium before executing tests. Refer [Appium Beginners Tutorials](http://www.seleniumtests.com/p/appium-tutorial.html) before running test else mobile site and mobile app tests would fail

If you use SauceLabs then you can pass Sauce Lab URL to execuete test on desired browser/app. Have a look at testng.xml for more details

You can clone this project and run tests as  

```mvn clean test```

Once test execution is over then you would find step by step report of all the test steps under -

```<path to your cloned directory>/seleniumtests/target/surefire-reports/SeleniumTestReport.html```
